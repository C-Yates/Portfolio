# Portfolio
My portfolio showcasing my web-design and software engineering skills

The whole portfolio project should be ready out of the box if you were to download these files. the only aspect that would need to be changed is the
stored location for images and js files. Feel free to dig into this and see how I've made things work.. 
It's a messy solution to suit my needs and is in no way optimised but this was a quick project and turned out alright!

The responsive design could use some work but aside from that it was a success
